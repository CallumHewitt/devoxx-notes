Recordings will be made available next week. But not all sessions are recorded. The hands on labs/coding cafes in particular won't be available.
Tools-in-action sessions are 30 minutes.
This evening is Java Jeopardy - The java version of Jeopardy on the Exhibition Floor.
Tomorrow night are ignite talks - Speakers are given 20 slides that auto-forward every 15 seconds. Some have signed up for blind ignites.
5 speakers from the LJC are doing their first lightning talks.

Tomorrow evening is the DevRocks party. This happens at a local brewery. To get entrance you need to get an invitation. You can get one by taking a picture with the Quarkus World Tour background at the Red Hat stand.

DevOxx UK have teamed up with RedHat for ___ day. Talking about OSS contributions and best practices.

Some sessions have shifted due to Covid. There are back up speakers who have filled in from those who have dropped out.

DevOxx is born out of the LJC.
