Someone reached out asking for IE support, because 5% of users are using it. This is critical for their business. Around 15% of people have accessibility requirements. More than 1bn people.

Disability != Personal Health Condition
Disability == Mismatched Human Interactions

We want to avoid mismatches between what we expect people to do and what they can do.

## WCAG Accesbility Principles

- Perceivable - can you see it
- Operable - can you use it
- Understandable - can you understand it
- Robust - it won't break future technologies

## 10 Habits to Create Accessible Content

1. Define accessibility in your domain
2. Convince your boss for all of the motivator reasons. The next 8 habits cost money
3. Use Personas
4. Test with one persona, extend to many
5. Learn from diversity
6. Iterate in small steps, do not leave accessibility for the last sprint
7. Use tools for developers: Accessibility Insights
8. Automate, for example with Github Actions
9. Innovate more, thanks to accessibility
10. Get training: aka.ms/accessibility-fundamentals

## Motivators

- It's a business imperative. Companies that embrace best practices have 28% higher revenue, 2x higher net income, 30% better performance on economic profit margin. *2018 Accenture Study
- Legislation
- Quality of Life - We're all expecting to live more that 10% of our life with accessibility issues. So do it for yourself if not for others.

## Accessibility Personas

Apply accessibility personas to your services.

There are a spectrum of personas. Most consider permanent disabilities, but there are many who have temporary disabilities. A heavy-accent is an accessibility issue sometimes for example.

If you fix for one type of person, you can fix it for many different types of people.

## Workflow mapping

Mapping a workflow and sending your personas through it, you can see what steps you accessibility failures pop up. If one step breaks, the whole workflow is broken for those users.

## Accessibility at each step

Doing accessibility at the start and throughout means that changes are far less expensive and are far more likely to happen. Include it at each step of your design process. Create it by default.

This matches up with modern development practices.

## Tools

AccessibilityInsights.io

The fast pass plugin will run through your website and find all kinds of issues. It won't see everything but it's a good way to get started.

## CI

github.com/microsoft/accessibility-insights-action

Accessibility insights are also available as github actions. All of the issues you've fixed will never come back again.

## Immersive Reader

In Teams there is an option called Immersive Reader, which will transform the UI into something more accessible. Big black text on White.

Once you start playing with it it has things like translations, provide pronunciation guides, or break it into syllables or even show pictures for certain words.

Accessibility is built into Microsoft Teams. We actually have new innovations arriving like helping people learn languages, whether adults or children. 

In PowerPoint there's a tool for automatically providing subtitles for what the speaker is saying. This also benefits people who want to watch the video on YouTube. The subtitles can be applied there too.

The software got *better* and more *innovative* by adding the accessibility features.
