## Mr Miyagi

From the Karate Kid. Mr Miyagi was the main character's karate mentor. He helped make Daniel a champion.

Mr Miyagi made the effort to selflessly pass on what they knew to the next generation, even without knowing them too well.

Mr Miyagi was not aggressive and would only fight to defend themselves. He taught Daniel both life lessons, and karate to defend themselves.

## Kelly's Mr Miyagi's

- Her own karate sensei
    - The karate school was one of the two best in the netherlands.
    - Sensei was devoted to teaching what he knew
    - Taught that you could achieve a lot with perseverance
    - Solve with compassion before karate.
    - Helped her be more confident at school
    - Had to deal with the big bully of the class, confident enough when it was needed
    - Made it to a brown belt, became national champion and third in Europe.
    - Mentoring had a huge impact on Kelly as a person, and is still of importance to her.
- Her time in the legal profession
    - Worked at a law firm as a part time job during her studies.
    - She had a good conversation with her mentor and the chemistry was right for that kind of relationship
    - Though they had difficulties they worked well together.
    - On the first day, she had to respond to a legal question from a client. A very basic task but someone needs to tell you. Her first legal document came back all in red with everything that needed correcting.
    - The move from theory to practice needed the mentor to help and Kelly became a lawyer with her help over time
    - Kelly assisted a woman who had recovered from cancer but her employer was acting strange. It became clear that they wanted to get rid of her and appeals in this context are very difficult to bring to court, but Kelly succeeded. This was as a result of learning the craft of a law from a mentor.
- Best friend
    - In 2014 Kelly quit the legal profession. Her father died and her unhealthy relationship ended, resulting in her losing her home.
    - Kelly's mentor helped her find a new path in life and a new profession and she became a security focussed software engineer

All of these mentoring relationships have been life changing and of great value.

## In IT

In IT, Kelly discovered that mentorships are not a matter of course. Kelly received training, internal courses and certificates and a Team Apps certificate related to quality engineering.

She learned in a fast paced environment but most of the time she was trying not to drown. There was no time for real guidance, and often answers to questions varied and were not consistent.

Kelly took a job interview and became a software engineer and once again found a mentor. There are plenty of times when Kelly has to google all of the jargon in a sentence and find answers to questions.

The thing that's missing is **context**. Often this is what is provided by the Mr Miyagi's of the tech world.

## What is mentoring?

EMCC Global definition - European Mentoring & Coaching Council

For the rest of the talk, we're focussing on the apprenticeship form of mentoring. Where the master trains the apprentice to become masters themselves.

## Robert Greene

Author of:

- The 48 Laws of Power
- Mastery

The ultimate form of power is mastery. In the book, he explains how masters of their chosen fields were apprenticed.

"The greatest system ever invented for the training of skills and the achievement of tacit knowledge"

Tacit knowledge = CONTEXT

## What does a mentor do?

A mentor helps the mentee by challenging and encouraging them. Being a sounding board. Providing moral support. Giving advice. Integrating them into work processes/culture/politics. Helping them to build a network.

They help the mentee to walk the path they already walked sharing their mistakes and their wins.

The relationship also benefits the mentor. The mentor is challenged in their own mastery. Their leadership skills, management skills and interpersonal skills are developed.

## Who is the mentor?

If mentorship is done in a thoughtful way. At it's worse it can do enormous harm to a person.

The relationship requires trust, respect and vulnerability. A good mentor is capable of giving constructive feedback and the mentee needs to be able to freely discuss with the mentor. The mentor has the mentee's best interests at heart.

## 10 Best Practices

1. A free choice
    - The mentor and mentee need to choose each other. You can't force a mentoring relationship. There needs to be good chemistry.
2. Train the mentor
    - It shouldn't be taken lightly. Let the mentor walk their own path with a set of basic skills. How to give feedback etc.
3. Match!
    - Let the mentor/mentee calibrate with each other. Discuss their do's and don'ts and that their interests and goals are aligned.
4. A trust based relationship
    - Give enough time, space and contact moments
5. An agenda
    - Set an agenda. Even if it's just a chat without an agenda. Set intermediate goals and have follow ups.
6. No copy & paste
    - Really important. The mentee is not a clone of the mentor. The mentee is not a mini-me. Have empathy.
    - Some things the mentor can learn now are easier because of what they already know.
7. The workflow
    - Get seniors who know what they're talking about, provide opportunities to learn and you'll get good employees in return
8. A mentoring programme
    - This is complimentary to basic training and is a multiplier to it's success.
9. The mentee's performance
    - The mentor is not responsible for the mentee's performance. It's up to the mentee as to what they do/don't do.
10. Mistakes and successes
    - Appreciate the mistakes and celebrate the successes. The greatest growth takes place outside of the comfort zone, but this is also where most of the mistakes are made.

## Mentoring is Crucial

As a community we have a big problem.

According to CompTIA's data, we're requring 3-10 years of experience. The demand for junior's lags behind.
75% of global IT decision makers are reporting a skills shortage. (Skillsoft's Global Knowledge 2021 IT Skills and Salary Report)
In the same report, in 2022 we're expecting to lose $775 bn worldwide because of this skills shortage.

In 2019 this was $302 bn.

There aren't enough qualified candidates in the industry right now.

Mentoring is the solution for the community's problem. It ensures learning and growth within the company's structure and talent development. This also leads to higher employee retention.

Performance is higher for employees with mentors and mentors themselves report higher job satisfaction. This is a cost-efficient and scalable way of creating the seniors of the future.

## Mentoring is like a Kata

It passes on a set of knowledge from one generation to the next, in a way that can't be learned better from other means.

## Questions

Is psychological safety to start mentoring?

- Of course it's important. It starts with meeting the mentor and that trust and meeting and conversations grows that psychological safety over time.

Mentor and mentees in the same team or different teams?

- I had a mentor in my own team. With an apprenticeship model you have those people within your own team. Of course, if you can't have that you can go out and find a mentor outside of your team.

Finding a mentor or being a mentor?

- One manner to do it is to just ask that person to be a mentor.
- If that's not a solution, other areas to go to would be `meetamentor.co.uk`. This is one of the LJC platforms. Another one would be `codingcoach.io`.

Tips for working remotely and having those face-to-face interactions

- Software Engineering job with the mentor was through Teams. Pair programming sessions happen a lot which is very useful for having those interactions.
- If you're pair programming make sure to give enough time for the junior to write code themselves.

How to politely reject a mentor relationship that hasn't worked out

- There's a gut feeling that tells you when you know this hasn't worked out. It often depends on the person or the situation.
